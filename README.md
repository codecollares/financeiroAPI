## FinanceiroAPI - Financial Control

A robust financial management system built to demonstrate solid software architecture and backend engineering. This project features a clean layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository), strict data validation using Jakarta Constraints, CORS configuration for API consumption, and a reactive frontend that calculates balances dynamically.

Technologies used:
- Java 25 & Spring Boot 3 (Backend)
- Spring Data JPA & H2 Database (Persistence)
- HTML5, Tailwind CSS & JavaScript Fetch API (Frontend)
- Docker (Containerization)

*PS: I used Claude Opus 4.5 and Gemini Pro 3.1 for code review and planning. AI is a great pair-programmer, but making the frontend DOM update without a page refresh? That was all me!*
